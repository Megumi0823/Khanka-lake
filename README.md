* Before running `ST-DBSCAN algorithm.py` and `Classification of extreme events.py`, it is necessary to extract the TWSA (Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly) values for the lake basin region. Then, first run `ST-DBSCAN algorithm.py` to perform the aggregation of extreme events in the lake basin region, followed by `Classification of extreme events.py` to classify the extreme events in the same region.  
* Before running `Characterization of Rapid Water Level Fluctuations in Lakes.py`, it is necessary to calculate the maximum rate of increase or decrease in lake water level fluctuations.
